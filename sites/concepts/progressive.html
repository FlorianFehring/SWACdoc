            <h1>Simply build progressive webapps with SWAC</h1>
            <p>SWAC includes features for progressive webapps. To make a webapp 
                installable on devices and useable offline a view configuration 
                steps are sufficient.</p>

            <h2>Prequisits</h2>
            <p>For useing the SWAC progressive the following prequisits are mendatory:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The whole page must be hostet over secure HTTPS</li>
                <li>SWAC framework must be accessable on the same domain under /SWAC</li>
                <li>The serviceworker.js script must be installed in root directory.</li>
                <li>The manifest.json must be installed in the root directory.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These things are needed, because the used serviceworker will only work 
            on HTTPS sites and has only access to sites and files on the same 
            directory level or deeper paths.
            <br>The neccessery structure is implemented in the SWAC template to make the first steps easy.</p>
            
            <h2>Make your webapp installable</h2>
            <p>To make your webapp installable on devices. Configure the manifest.json</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Name, description and colors should be changed to describe your app.</li>
                <li>Exchange the default icons in /content</li>
                <li>icon paths are allready configured to meet the default paths for SWAC applications.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Configure the configuration.js</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Set option "intallable" to true</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Make your webapp progressive</h2>
            <p>Progressive webapps did not only make your webapp offline useable. 
                It also improves performance, when the user is online.
                <br>SWAC implements a widly automated progressive mode.</p>

            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
...

progressive: {
    active: true,

...
        </code></pre>

            <h2>Progressive SWAC features</h2>
            <p>Below are the features for progressive webapps with SWAC are explained.</p>
            
            <h3>Intelligent cacheing</h3>
            <p>Once activated the progressive mode will cache the webapp on users devices, 
            as soon as they enter the app. Cacheing effects automatically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The page the user entered</li>
                <li>All content files on that page</li>
                <li>All language files of the language the user currently uses.</li>
                <li>All data files and REST api calls (GET requests only) on that page</li>
                <li>All Components used on that page</li>
                <li>Direct linked pages, their contents and components.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>New visited pages are cached on visit.</p>
            
            <h3>Offline fallback content</h3>
            <p>If your application is offline and some sources could not be loaded
                from cache, than fallbacks are used to show the users information on how
                to get the latest content.</p>

            <h2>Add files for precaching</h2>
            <p>To add files for precaching, that would normally not be cached (e.g. offline files for your app).
            Add them to the cachefiles list. Note that every file must be noted with path from the root directory of your webapp.</p>

            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
...

progressive: {
        active: true,
        cachefiles [
            // default data
            '/data/myofflinedata.json'
        ],
...
        </code></pre>
            
            <h2>Cacheing and CORS</h2>
            <p>If SWAC is used on a domain, and other content (such as libs from CDNs, files from media server, etc.)
            The service worker will not be able to cache content from those sources, because of the CORS policy in modern browsers.
            <br>In this cases the content will be fetched each time, resulting in the effect, that your application will not be 
            offline useable untill the needed files are cached by "normal" browser file cache.
            <br>You can solve this by makeing the content CORS allowed. This of couse must be done on the CDN server.
            <br>Example for a .hataccess file</p>
            
            <pre><code>
&lt;FilesMatch "\.(mp3)$"&gt;
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
